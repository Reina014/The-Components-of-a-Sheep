# The-Components-of-a-Sheep
This is a critical making project done independently by Reina Huang at New York University.

By applying both codes of Processing and Arduino, the project created an interactive prototype that aims to advocate for animal welfare.
The project targets adults in China, especially children, in an attempt to draw their attention to existing animal cruelty.
